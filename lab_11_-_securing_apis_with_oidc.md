# Lab 11 - Securing APIs with OpenID Connect {#lab-11-securing-apis-with-oidc}

{% hint style='info' %}
In this lab you will modify the first API to use OpenID Connect as the authentication mechanism, using a Red Hat Single Sign-ON instance running in the same OCP cluster.

**OpenID Connect 1.0** is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

**OpenID Connect** allows clients of all types, including Web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The specification suite is extensible, allowing participants to use optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session management, when it makes sense for them.
