{% hint style='info' %}
Plans are used for granting access to specific APIs and endpoints, limiting traffic and monetizing API usage. Application plans let you configure access rights to an API by specifying rate limits and pricing rules. All applications must be associated with a plan. Application plans can be customized for one application.
